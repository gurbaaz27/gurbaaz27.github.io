Each journey of my project can be summarised to the following quote by, *lemme google it*, Denis Waitle:-

# "Expect the best, plan for the worst, and prepare to be surprised."

*I plan on adding comprehensive informal discussion revolving around my projects, but for now I would recommend visiting my [__Github Profile__](https://github.com/gurbaaz27), and/or my [Curriculum vitae](/assets/docs/cv.pdf).*
