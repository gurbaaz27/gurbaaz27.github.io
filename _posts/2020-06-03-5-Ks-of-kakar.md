The motivation behind posting this on instagram was to create an awareness regarding one of the core part in the life of a "*Amritdhari*" or a borrowed term from the West, "baptised" Sikh. I have seen friends and strangers who get amused or wierdly astonished at the sight of my long hair or my kirpan. I usually don't mind as this might be new to them, coming from a different background or even a whole different part of the world. Still one cannot deny the mockery or hate spread on a global scale as a result of lack of complete info. In fact, the portrayal of Sikhs and their religious symbols and cries, their culture has been heavily distorted in the past decades at the hands of media, for which I would recommend watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlojJCbqPJA) by Stand-up comedian Jaspreet Singh. The sad state exists within the community too. I can bet even in Sikh families, many people, especially from younger generation may not even be able to tell all the five kakãrs, or when was this started and/or what purpose do they serve.

The five *kakãrs* are basically five items that the 10th *Guru*, Guru Gobind Singh Ji commanded the *Khalsa* (derived from the Arabic word "*Khalis*" "خَالِصٌ" which means "to be pure") to wear at all times since the creation of Khalsa in the *Vaisakhi* (roughly 13th of April) of 1699. Amritdhari Sikhs dont worship *kakãrs*, though sure these are the articles which a Sikh hold in high faith. They serve a daily life practical purpose and/or are a constant reminder of a virtue or a teaching.

So here is an attempt to briefly summarise the five *kakãrs* (notice the constant usage of tilda(~) above letter 'a'. It distincts the pronounciation of the word from *kakar*).

## Kesh: *Uncut Hair*

Sikhs honor this physical process of growth of hair as accepting the intent of the creator. Usually, a turban is worn to protect them. Hair has always been respected and kept long since ages, especially by saints and philosophers, as it protects the main core of all nerves, our brain. Hence, it is seen as a symbol of spiritual devotion.

## Kangha: *Wooden Comb*

Worn in hair only, comb helps to maintain hair  clean and untangled, and stands for cleaniness and grace. Unlike plastic combs,wooden comb doesnt produce static charge and hamper with brain and neurons. 

## Kara: *Iron Bracelet*

Traditionally the kara served as a protective wrist guard for the Khalsa warrior. The circle symbolizes God as a never-ending entity. Kara also shows a bonding to the community and to God Himself. (Hindi word '*Kari*' stands for link.)

## Kirpaan: *Iron Dagger*

Word '*kirpa*' itself stands for mercy, and kirpan is meant for self-defense and defending the weak from tyranny. It also serves as a constant reminder of a personal battle with our vices within. The kirpan is never meant to attack first.

## Kachera: *Cotton Undergarment*

A loose undergarment designed for ease of movement while maintaining modesty, whether worshipping, practicing martial arts, or doing any other daily chore. It was(, and is) light, easy to maintain as compared to other traditional under-garments of that era, like the dhoti.

> "Don’t be afraid to share what you know, because you know it better than anyone else!"

It is always possible to give wrong or inadequate information, so do correct me on anything such. I would more than happy to make those changes here. Till then,

> **_Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa! Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh!_**

, which is a Sikh greeting meaning:- "*Khalsa* belongs to the *Waheguru* (wonderful Lord) and also the *Fateh* (victory) belongs to the *Waheguru* only."
