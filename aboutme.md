subtitle: A non-exhaustive snippet describing me.

Hailing from Jalandhar, Punjab, I am currently pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur (*typical Indian stereotypical vibesâ€¦.r8?*). I love to meet different people, talk over various indulging topics, ranging from philosophy to gaming, from latest trends academics to the recent of memes, from praising a piece of work to criticising the hell out of it. I am ever-ready to collaborate on a team-project.

Nowadays I am exploring Deep Learning and particularly inclined towards it, though I share enthusiasm in CP and puzzles, and have a fair exposure to App and Web Development (*pythonic, not javascript. JS is my nightmare, atleast as of now*). I love reading books and learn interesting concepts. I do love astronomy and stuff, and, *insert self-promotion*, currently one of the 4 coordinators of [Astronomy Club](https://astroclubiitk.github.io) at IIT Kanpur.

Formalities apart, I am a lowkey roaster :P.
