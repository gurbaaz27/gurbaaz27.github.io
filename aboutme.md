subtitle: A non-exhaustive snippet describing me.

Hailing from Jalandhar, Punjab, I am currently pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur. I love to meet different people, talk over various indulging topics, ranging from philosophy to gaming, from latest trends academics to the recent of memes, from praising a piece of work to criticising the hell out of it. I am ever-ready to collaborate on a team-project.

Nowadays I am exploring Docker and K8s, much dreaded but key concepts for scability and containerisation. I have got quite an experience in Deep Learning and particularly inclined towards it, though I also share enthusiasm in CP and puzzles, and have a fair exposure to App dev in Flutter and Web Development in Django and React. I plan to dive peer into 2 domains which intrigue me a lot but I have kept aside for much time: cryptocurrency and cybersecurity. I enjoying reading books and learning interesting concepts. I do love astronomy and stuff, and, *insert club promotion*, currently one of the 4 coordinators of [Astronomy Club](https://astroclubiitk.github.io) at IIT Kanpur. I recently learnt cubing, and currently just manage to clock 3*3 rubiks cube to 1:30 min. _Not that bad, right?_ Still, a long way to go...

Formalities apart, I am a lowkey roaster :P, more or less ever-ready for a "_bulla_" session.
