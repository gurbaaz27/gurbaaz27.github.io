Hi!<br>
I am Gurbaaz Singh Nandra. I live in Jalandhar city, an industry-centric city in the heart of Punjab, India. Currently. I am a final year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur. I would be joining Quadeye Securities as a Systems Engineer, focused on designing low-latency trading systems, primarily in C++. 

Over my years of stay at the institute, I had been lucky to explore variety of domains, be it technical, cultural, politics or sports. I participated in Dramatics in my freshmen year, guided and mentored junior freshers as a Student Guide and Academic Mentor in my sophomore year. I also took up management and administrative roles in the past, in the form of Coordinator at Astronomy Club and Senator at Students' Gymkhana.

My technical interests are manifold, primarly focused on low-level systems programming and different programming paradigms. I have fair share of experience in Machine Learning and AI, building models and software tools utilising Computer Vision and NLP. I enjoy Backend Engineering and DevOps, always looking to transform a stream of thoughts and ideas into reality. I have built a fair share of discord bots and crawlers as part of freelancing.

As my tech hobbies, I love to read about latest developments in the open-source community, watch videos on system-design and explore different programming languages and tech stacks. In indoor sports, I play pool and table tennis, or fiddle around with Rubik's cube in my free time. Nowadays I am trying to get comfortable in snooker. This year I am also putting a conscious effort to develop a habit of reading books regularly. Occasionally, I like to pen down my thoughts and ideas in notion.
