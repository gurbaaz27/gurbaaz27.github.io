If you came across this link and are currently reading this, high chances are you are someone from IIT Kanpur or some friend/relative/professor to whom I have given this link at some point in time of my life. There also is a very low but possible chance of you being a web scraper or a stalker. Whatever it is, you are welcome here.<br><br>

Let's start with clearing some air off the name of my homepage: "The Hawk's Nest". So my name Gurbaaz can be split to "<i>Gur</i>" for Guru (<i>here specifically it is Sikh Guru</i>) and "<i>Baaz</i>" is for Hawk(<i>/Falcon</i>). So my name actually refers to the <a href="https://www.theheritagelab.in/8-things-learn-guru-gobind-singhs-baaj/">Baaz</a> which stayed alongside the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Hence I chose "The Hawk's Nest" as the title for my page. And I have to agree with you, it ain't one of the best. So, do let me know any better idea for name in your mind.<br><br>

Make your way around my homepage, and check out all the tabs relevant to you. See ya!
