If you stumbled upon this link and are currently reading this, high chances are you got redirected here from one of my socials, or you are a friend / relative / professor / company recruiter with whom I have shared this link at some point in time of my life. There is also a very low but possible chance of you being a web crawler (<em>data is the new oil</em>), a stalker or just a random admirer. Whatever it is, you are welcome here.<br><br>
<!-- What are you doing reading my commented stuff? :/
	Anyways, as you are here, go through this bit of trivia about my name(and old title of my page).

	Let's start with clearing some air off the name of my homepage: "The Hawk's Nest". So my name Gurbaaz can be split to "<i>Gur</i>" for Guru (<i>here specifically it is Sikh Guru</i>) and "<i>Baaz</i>" is for Hawk(<i>/Falcon</i>). So my name actually refers to the <a href="https://www.theheritagelab.in/8-things-learn-guru-gobind-singhs-baaj/">Baaz</a> which stayed alongside the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Hence I chose "The Hawk's Nest" as the title for my page. And I have to agree with you, it ain't one of the best. So, do let me know any better idea for name in your mind.<br><br>
