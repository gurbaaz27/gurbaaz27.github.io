If you came across this link and are currently reading this, high chances are you are someone from IIT Kanpur or some friend/relative/professor to whom I have given this link at some point in time of my life. There also is a very low but possible chance of you being a web scraper or a stalker. Whatever it is, you are welcome here. Let's start off with clearing some air off the name "The Hawk's Nest". So my name Gurbaaz can be split to "Gur" for Guru (<i>here specifically it is Sikh Guru</i>) and "Baaz" is for Hawk. So my name actually refers to Baaz which stayed alongside the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Hence I chose "The Hawk's Nest" as the title for my page. And I have to agree with you, it ain't one of the best. So, do let me know any better idea for name in your mind.

Make you way around my homepage, and check out all the relevant tabs to you. See ya!
